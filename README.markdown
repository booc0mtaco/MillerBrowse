Miller Browse
=============

#### Build NeXT- / Mac OS X Finder-style hierarchical broswers with ease ####

This plugin is built using prototype.js and is likely not suitable for most 
production sites today. However, if the time comes where there is a desire
to support it on jQuery/zepto, I will rewrite it. In the mean time...

Miller Browse is a JavaScript plugin that allows you to build a 
[Miller Columns](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller_columns)-based navigation. It 
supports both statically- & dynamically-generated data. It's OK.

Assuming there is a call for it, the following work needs doing:

* Minification
